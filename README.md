The two most common operations I run into with image files are resizing and converting.  There are plenty of reasons to work on images in Gimp or Paint.Net or Photoshop but they're not built to do simple batch operations like this quickly. QuickFixMyPic is.

You can right click on an image file or up to 16 in windows explorer to launch the program with them already queued.

You can add more to the queue by clicking browse or by going to File > Browse For File(s) or Select Folder or simple the Browse button next to the Convert To dropdown list.

When you are satified with your choices simple click Engage and your new files will appear in the same folder as the source files they are reading.

# Installing

You can install by simply [downloading the msi](https://github.com/Echostorm44/QuickFixMyPic/releases/download/1.0.3.0/SetupQuickFixMyPic.msi) from the release page

You can download and unzip [this pack](https://github.com/Echostorm44/QuickFixMyPic/releases/download/1.0.3.0/QuckFixMyPic.zip) and use is as portable but you won't have the shell right click integration the installer adds

You could be all fancy and use a cli packager like the l33t haxx0r you are...

Via [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli):

```powershell
winget install FleetingClarityStudios.QuickFixMyPic
```
